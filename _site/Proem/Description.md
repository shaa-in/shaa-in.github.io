# Proem Architectural Firm - Website Documentation

## Overview
Proem is an architectural firm aiming for a minimalistic online presence, with a particular color scheme and branding guideline. The website will serve as a digital portfolio, showcasing a select number of projects and essential information about the firm.

## Current Status
The website is in its initial design phase with a basic scaffold set up for the index page. Bootstrap has been integrated to provide responsive design capabilities.


### Scaffold Details:
- **Navigation Section**: Contains the Proem logo on the top-left and a vertical menu on the top-right with the items: PROJECTS, PUBLICATIONS, and PRACTICE.

### Main Section Templates:

- **Main Content Section**: Contains two equal Bootstrap columns intended for primary content, likely to showcase the firm's works or other details.

- We've got three main layout designs:
    1. **Single Column**: Just one main column that takes up the entire width. We'll use this for the homepage.
    2. **Double Column**: Two columns, side by side. This will be for the PRACTICE page.
    3. **Triple Column**: Three columns, side by side. This will display six projects on the project page.

### Footer:

The footer retains the same padding as the body section, thus ensuring design uniformity. The choice of colors remains subtle and aligned with the brand guidelines.

- We'll go for a clean look. No background color (or white, if preferred). 
- On the left, there'll be a small copyright text in gray, "Â© 2023 Proem Architects"
- Right , there's going to be an Instagram icon. The Instagram icon is appropriately placed to the extreme right, ensuring a balanced look across devices.
- On larger screens (tablets, desktops), the copyright text also includes "All Rights Reserved" 


### Projects Index Page:

- We need a grid layout with three columns.
- Each item in the grid is an image representing a project.
- When clicked, these images should lead to the corresponding project page.


### Project Page:

- The project page will be split in half:
    1. **Left Side**: Contains the project's description, centered vertically, and aligned to the right.
    2. **Right Side**: A box with a grayish background where the project's image goes. If the image doesn't cover the entire box, the gray background shows.
  

## Brand Guidelines Followed:
- **Logo**: Positioned at the top-left. Abiding by the clear space rule, we've ensured that no text or other graphical elements come within 50% of the logo's height. We've used a placeholder logo size; this needs to be adjusted based on the actual logo provided.


- On mobile phones, when held vertically, the website width gets pretty tiny. So, the logo needs to be downsized to fit better.

- **Color**: The primary color used for interactive text (like the menu) is Scarlet Red (HEX #EF373E). The default text color is a shade of black (R:20, G:20, B:19).

- **Typography**: The font 'Avenir Medium' is intended to be used across the website, ensuring consistency with the brand guidelines. However, for the current scaffold, the system default font is applied due to the unavailability of 'Avenir Medium' on standard platforms. This will need to be integrated.


## Future Tasks:
1. **Integrate 'Avenir Medium' Font**: We need to acquire the font and integrate it for accurate representation.
  
2. **Add Content to Main Section**: Details about the structure of the main content area are pending, which will determine how we utilize the two columns.
  
3. **Project Detail Pages**: As the website will showcase select projects, we'll need detailed pages for each project once the main layout is finalized.
  
4. **Footer**: A footer section could be added to incorporate any additional links, contact information, and legal details.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Once the desktop version is polished, ensure the website is responsive and looks good on mobile and tablet devices.

6. **Interactivity**: Consider adding subtle animations or interactivity for an enhanced user experience without detracting from the minimalistic approach.

7. **Testing and Feedback**: Continuously test the website on different devices and browsers. Gather feedback, especially from the client, and iterate upon it.
