The downtown area of Belo Horizonte, known as Hipercentro, is renowned for its distinctive urban design characterized by wide, tree-lined streets intersected by diagonals. However, the location of SENAC faces challenges due to its proximity to major transportation facilities. To address this, a proposed incision in Block 1 would create a connection between the public space and the interior of the lot.

This opening resolves level disparities, revitalizes the block's microclimate through vegetation, and establishes a clear access point with a generous staircase. Ultimately, this design fosters a dialogue between the SENAC complex and the vibrant city center, promoting a harmonious integration with the urban context.
