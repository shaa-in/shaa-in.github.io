Our design for the Quarteira Cultural Park in Portugal embodies the most progressive, contemporary, efficient, and sustainable model for an international cultural center.

As the winners of the competition entry, our vision presented an ongoing annual program that celebrated diverse artists and choreographic styles under independent artistic direction and professional management.

The cultural park prioritized audience and artistic development, fostering engagement through educational initiatives and collaborations.

With the availibility of the facilities for research, residency, production, and presentation, our design incorporated and linked all parts of the creative chain, efficiently serving a variety of
artists without them needing comprehensive
infrastructures.
