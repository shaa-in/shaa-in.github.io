Our competition entry for an Intergenerational Center in Quinta das Garridas, Lisbon.

A thoughtfully balanced proposal embraces the program's aspiration for ageless vibrancy, innovation, and modernity. The choice of materials and furnishings for the interior spaces, while youthful and non-institutional, exudes durability, resilience, and timelessness, allowing for a unique and distinct maturing over time.

A relentless pursuit of authenticity guided the conception and production of this proposal. Precise, rigorous, and solid material selection, preserving the building's tectonic evidence, enhances the architecture's qualities and contribution to the project.
