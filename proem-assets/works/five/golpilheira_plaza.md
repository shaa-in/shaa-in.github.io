A Completed Urban Design project in Golpilheira, a village steeped in history along the Lena Valley. From the 15th-century Chapel of Senhor Bom Jesus dos Aflitos to the 1950s-built Nossa Senhora de FÃ¡tima Church, each edifice holds a special place in this close-knit community's heart. As architects, we're entrusted with preserving this heritage and enhancing public spaces.

The design process thrives on the fusion of history and innovation. By repurposing existing infrastructure, like the grand staircase and surrounding walls and crafting an urban landscape that embodies the essence of Golpilheira.

One striking aspect is our emphasis on material representation. Through artistic tile panels and stone pavements; drawing a vivid tapestry that communicates various functions of public space. Each material echoes a story: the enduring tiles symbolize Portugal's heritage, while the stone underfoot signifies transition and connection.
