Competition Entry, runner up 2021

Reviving Thessaloniki's Heart: Our proposal aims to breathe new life into the Thessaloniki International Fair (T.I.F.), blending history with innovation.

By creating a compact, easily navigable space with a regional and international identity, while prioritizing sustainability, economic growth, and critical preservation of heritage.

The 'Aerial Path,' a breathtaking bridge, connects it all, offering panoramic views and a public space for everyone. Join us as we transform T.I.F. into a vibrant hub that bridges the past with the future, embracing Thessaloniki's rich cultural heritage.
